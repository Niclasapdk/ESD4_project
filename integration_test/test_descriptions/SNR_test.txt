The SNR test were made with a Keysight DSOX1102G oscilloscope.
First the signal generator was connected to the first channel on the oscilloscope and the input of the element, with a T-connector.
Then the output of the element were connected to the second channel of the oscilloscope.
The input was a 1 kHz signal of the maximum input voltage, with the expecption of the equalizer, for which a 5 kHz signal was used (This is the frequency with the highest gain).
Then an FFT of the output were measured for in dB, and compared with the noise which was the output when the input was turned of.
To get the SNR the signal value were subtracted with the noise value.
