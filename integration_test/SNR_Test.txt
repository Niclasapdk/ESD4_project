SNR tested at 5kHz for the EQ and 1kHz for everything else
FFT is used in the span of 20Hz-20kHz, to get the meassure.
The oscilloscope can max
REQMax signal = -19.4 dB
REQMax noise = -65 dB
REQMax SNR = 45.6 dB
LEQMax signal = -19.0 dB
LEQMax noise = -65 dB
LEQMax SNR = 46 dB
LRIAA+OPAMP signal = -25 dB
LRIAA+OPAMP noise = -48 dB
LRIAA+OPAMP SNR = 23 dB
RRIAA+OPAMP signal = -24.9 dB
RRIAA+OPAMP noise = -48 dB
RRIAA+OPAMP SNR = 23.1 dB
LRIAA signal = -42 dB
LRIAA noise = -65 dB
LRIAA SNR = 23 dB
RRIAA signal = -42 dB
RRIAA noise = -65 dB
RRIAA SNR = 23 dB
RPreAmpOPAMP signal = -22 dB
RPreAmpOPAMP noise = -62 dB
RPreAmpOPAMP SNR = 40 dB
LPreAmpOPAMP signal = -62 dB
LPreAmpOPAMP noise = -22 dB
LPreAmpOPAMP SNR = 40 dB
RClassA signal = -21.6 dB
RClassA noise = -62 dB
RClassA SNR = 40.4 dB
LClassA signal = -21.6 dB
LClassA noise = -63 dB
LClassA SNR = 41.4 dB

Because of the Oscilloscopes resolution, it is not possible to get readings of more than 50 dB difference.
Since we are trying to get the most pessimistic values, this ends up being around 40-45 dB SNR each time.
