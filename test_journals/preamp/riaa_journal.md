# RIAA and Inverting OP-Amp Test Journal 

## Reason
* Ensuring compliance with the standard RIAA transfer function and chosen gain at 1kHz.
* Validating the final output Vrms is within requirements.


## Method

Generate a sine signal of 1kHz with an amplitude of 5 mVrms from a function generator and input it into the RIAA.
Use an oscilloscope to the measure the output signal Vrms and record the data.

Perform a frequency response with the oscilloscope and record the data.

## Result
