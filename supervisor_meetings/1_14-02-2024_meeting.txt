Our current progress:
Instead of darlington, we can design inverted darlingtons instead which is used to reduce the required cooling.

Which direction will the project go in:
See picture (It is important to make a good filter (High degree) parting the bass and discant)

What does supervisor think of problemanalysis:
-Before meeting we think that an introduction + a section about the different classes of amplifiers will do

There is not a lot of standard with the requirements.
Sounds okay with the scope of the problemanalysis.



We should probably analyse the different voltage and current amplifications of each box (Input stage, VAS and Output stage).


We can make an mdf board with nails and solder the components on it, to test our circuit.



Supervisor meeting friday, where we will learn how to do transistor
